ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rockylovescoding

I am 15-years old boy and i have started to
learn programming with Python at december 2020.
I live in Finland and thats why im not so good
at english.

Im interested in computers, especially in
coding and hacking. Im think on intermediate
level in Python and im really newbie. 

If you have a problem with coding, i try
to help you and i can teach you basics of
Python (but im not the best person to do it).

Just contant me with email if you want help:

Have a nice day :)
